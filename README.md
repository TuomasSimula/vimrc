## .vimrc with version control

My .vimrc vim configuration file with some added bash scripts to automatise version control.
Setup.sh sets everything up, update-vimrc.sh runs automatically on login to update the vimrc and push-to-git.sh runs when vimrc is edited to (optionally) push changes to git. Run reset.sh to revert changes done by setup.sh.
